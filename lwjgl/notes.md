Uses a **Right Handed System**

### DirectX

Uses a **Left Handed System**

# Terms

## Graphics Pipeline

Term used to describe the OPENGL flow that allows for flexibility in graphics processing.

## Vertex

Describes a point in 2d/3d space (x,y,z).

### Vertex Buffer

Packs all vertices that need to be rendered.

### Vertex Array Objects (VAO)

An object that contains one or more VBOs which are usually called attribute lists.
Each attribute list can hold one type of data: position, colour, texture, etc. You are free to store whichever you want in each slot.

### Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO)

A VBO is just a memory buffer stored in the graphics card memory that stores vertices.

## Fragment

?? Group of rasterized triangles?

## Shader
### Vertex Shader
### Geometry Shader
### Fragment Shader

## Frame

### Frame Buffer

## Vector Graphics

- Used when making precise geometric shapes or complex data can be distilled down to simple geometric shapes.
- Based on geometric coordinates
Think of architecture or a graphic designer making a logo. 

## Raster Graphics

Represents a 2d image as a grid of square pixels.
